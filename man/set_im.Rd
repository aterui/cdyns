\title{Utility: set immigration}
\usage{
set_im(n_sim, n_species, immigration, sd_immigration, stochastic)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_sim}{Total number of simulation run.}

\item{n_species}{Number of species in a simulated community.}

\item{immigration}{Mean immigration per generation. Immigration is determined as \code{m ~ N(log(immigration), sd_immigration^2)}}

\item{sd_immigration}{SD immigration over time in a log scale.}

\item{stochastic}{Whether demographic stochasticity is induced or not. If TRUE, population & immigration outcomes will be a random draws from a Poisson distribution with the expected value of population density or immigration.}
